#Notes

-First things first, installing semantics from the instructions on the site was horrible. It didn't work, I finally found this blog after 3 hours of trialing and error https://videotutorialspot.com/2019/01/08/semantic-ui-for-react-install-and-getting-started/
- Even using that website, I found that you needed to also install semantic-ui-css

-I'm going to use the semantics elemnts, but I'll probably style this myself because I've already sunk 3 hours into setting up semantics and I'm sure it's not 100% right.

-I'm getting the hange of Semantics I can see why this would be used often. I wish I could figure out how to add the customization, but I had a lot of trouble initially with the setup

-The notes are scarce because I spent to much time attempting to setup semantic UI, that I didn't have time to write down every thought I had like the last project. I'll do my best to fill in things I remember.

- I can see a difference in feed types, between videos and channel updates, I can group components that way

- Modal can use some styling improvements

- If I had more time I'd improve the styling a lot. I want to make sure this isn't late so I'll submit as is and explain the styling when the time comes. I'm not attempting to hide it, just explain why it looks the way it does, things I would change are
- - Modal layout, list could look better
- - Icons can be pushed to the top of the list if content is to long
- - Change styling for some of the headers
- - I'd love to add some color, but that would take a long time to pick the right pallette

- I'd also like to start a helpers folder and create a helper for generating the icon/placeholder
